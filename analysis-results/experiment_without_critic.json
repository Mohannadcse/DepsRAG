Since there is 1 package with 65 dependencies, the density can be calculated as the number of edges (dependencies) divided by the number of possible edges between vertices (packages). However, with only the total number of dependencies provided, we cannot calculate the exact density without knowing the number of edges that could possibly exist between all packages. Typically, density is calculated as D = E/N(N-1), where E is the number of edges and N is the number of nodes. In this case, we would need the total number of nodes (packages including dependencies) to calculate the exact density.",
